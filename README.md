## Simulations of performance of fgwas ##

These directories contain the data and code I used to test the performance of fgwas. Scripts are customized to the cluster I use and will thus need to be modified to run on machines other than mine.


### Requirements ###
[hapgen2](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/hapgen/hapgen2.html)

[fgwas](https://github.com/joepickrell/fgwas)

### Description ###
Simulations were based on 111 random regions (2 per chromosome, plus an extra chromosome 22 region) from real 1000 Genomes data.
